# Natural Language Processing with Transformers

### Building Language Applications with Hugging Face

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not just an exploration of information and patterns within text classification and generation, but also a gateway to practical applications like sentiment analysis and text classification for electoral models in the United States.

Data science encompasses various methods and theories from many mathematics, statistics, and computer science fields. This repository is devoted to a deeper understanding of "Natural Language Processing" in Data Science, particularly as a Machine Learning model and tool, with exercises and solutions from the well-regarded book "NLP with Transformers" (Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra & Thomas Wolf, 2022).

This repository's primary aim is to provide an accessible yet comprehensive resource for those embarking on a journey in data science.

The repository will provide explanations, solutions, and insights into the numerous exercises mentioned in the book above.

#### Purpose of This Study

This study and review of the book serve an educational purpose for developing personal projects as a data scientist.
The motivations are centered around understanding how state-of-the-art transformer models operate, which will later aid in conducting sentiment analysis and text classification for electoral models in the United States. 

Furthermore, this knowledge lays a solid foundation for future constructions with 'Machine Learning Engineering' application models. Lastly, the acquired expertise will facilitate the creation of chatbots and enable sentiment analysis on customers visiting newly established companies by myself.

#### If necessary as follow:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
source env/bin/deactivate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Github Environment

Performed from Terminal Console
```sh
1. git init
2. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"]
3. git remote -v
4. git add -A
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "insert here your commit"
7. git status

```

### Additional GitHub Commands
if you already created your repository, then:
```sh
1. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"] 
2. same procedure applied above
3. Note: if you already got your ReadMe.md & License.md then,
firstly request your git pull origin master. THIS IS ALWAYS A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE.
4. git push origin master
```
